**Primary Form Location:** SeedProd Pro landing page hero section
**Form Type:** Multi-step WPForms Pro lead capture
**Integration Points:**
- Hero section primary CTA button
- Service-specific landing page forms
- Mobile-optimized conversion flow

**Technical Implementation:**
```html
<!-- SeedProd Landing Page Integration -->
<div class="hero-conversion-section">
  <h1>Transform Your Kitchen & Bathroom with New Jersey's Licensed Experts</h1>
  <p>Licensed Master Electrician Pedro Ribeiro - Serving Union, Essex, Middlesex & Bergen Counties</p>
  
  <!-- WPForms Pro Multi-Step Form -->
  [wpforms id="1001" title="false" description="false"]
  
  <div class="trust-indicators">
    <span>âœ“ Licensed Master Electrician #13VH13054200</span>
    <span>âœ“ Bonded & Insured</span>
    <span>âœ“ 15+ Years Experience</span>

</div>
```

### Phase 2: WordPress Site Integration
**Form Locations:**

**Conditional Form Display:**
```php
// WordPress template integration
if (is_page('kitchen-remodeling')) {
    echo do_shortcode('[wpforms id="1002" title="false"]'); // Kitchen-specific form
} elseif (is_page('bathroom-renovation')) {
    echo do_shortcode('[wpforms id="1003" title="false"]'); // Bathroom-specific form
} else {
    echo do_shortcode('[wpforms id="1001" title="false"]'); // General multi-service form
}
```
